# Project_1

Potential questions: 
  Is there a correlation between rates of undernourishment and/or obesity and COVID deaths?
  Is there correlation between alcohol consumption and COVID deaths?
  Do any other dietary trends correlate with COVID death rates?

Data Visualizations:
  Pie charts of percentages of food consumed per country for countries with lowest and highest death rates, and countries of interest (USA, Mexico, Italy,  UK, India, China)
  Scatter plots of Death Rates/Cases vs Undernourishment/Obesity/Alcohol
