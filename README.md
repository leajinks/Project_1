# Project_1

In this project, we explore a dataset that incorporates data from December 2020 to compare different types of food intake, world population obesity, and global COVID-19 cases. We researched the following questions:

What is the relationship between COVID-19 infection and death rates and factors generally understood to be associated with health issues such as obesity and alcohol consumption?
Are there any strong correlations between different types of food and COVID-19 cases?
What are the dietary compositions of the countries with the highest and lowest COVID cases per capita?

The code in the pynb file uses data from the Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data.csv file in the COVID_Diet_Data folder to clean and consolidate the data, then output graphs in the Saved Graphs folder. The list of food categories and their descriptions are in the Supply_Food_Data_Descriptions.csv file in the COVID_Diet_Data folder, however, some of these categories were combined and/or renamed, as seen in the pynb file.

The raw data is available from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset.
